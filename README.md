# üê± Kitty adoption app - Week #1

[![Workflow result](https://github.com/opatry/android-dev-challenge-compose-week1/workflows/Check/badge.svg)](https://github.com/opatry/android-dev-challenge-compose-week1/actions/workflows/Check.yaml)

## :scroll: Description

This is a simple master/detail app with a fake list of clickable data displaying more detailed information about it.

## :bulb: Motivation and Context

My goal was mainly to see how Jetpack Compose handles Navigation and Multiple form factor/layouts.

I'm proud of my work because I started late (was in holiday when challenge was first announced) and didn't spent a lot of time on this.  
Still, I managed to submit a working version on time implementing Jetpack navigation and dedicated support of tablet.

---

I used MVVM, Unidirectional Data Flow and UI State pattern.  
Each state has its own composable, see `CatsScreen.kt`.

<details>
<summary>Show me the code!</summary>

```kotlin
@Composable
fun CatsScreen(viewModel: CatsViewModel, selectedCat: CatModel?, onCatSelected: (CatModel) -> Unit) {
    Scaffold(
        topBar = { /* */ },
        content = {
            val state by viewModel.catsState.observeAsState(CatsScreenState.Loading)
            CatsStateDispatcher(uiState = state, selectedCat, onCatSelected)
        }
    )
}

@Composable
fun CatsStateDispatcher(uiState: CatsScreenState, selectedCat: CatModel?, onCatSelected: (CatModel) -> Unit) {
    when (uiState) {
        CatsScreenState.Loading -> LoadingCatsContent()
        is CatsScreenState.Error -> ErrorCatsContent(uiState.cause)
        CatsScreenState.Empty -> EmptyCatsContent()
        is CatsScreenState.Loaded -> LoadedCatsContent(uiState.cats, selectedCat, onCatSelected)
    }
}
```

I implemented a `MainLayout` composable to choose how to present the UI depending on device configuration, see `MainActivity.kt/MainLayout`.

<details>
<summary>Show me the code!</summary>

```kotlin
sealed class NavRoute(val path: String) {
    object CatsList : NavRoute("cats")
    object CatDetails : NavRoute("cat.details")
}

@Composable
fun MainLayout(catRepository: CatRepository = (CatRepository((FakeCatDataSource())))) {
    val catsViewModel = viewModel<CatsViewModel>(factory = CatsViewModelFactory(catRepository))
    Surface(color = MaterialTheme.colors.background) {
        if (booleanResource(R.bool.is_tablet)) {
            var selectedCatUUID by rememberSaveable { mutableStateOf<UUID?>(null) }
            val selectedCat = selectedCatUUID?.let { uuid ->
                catsViewModel.findCatByUUID(uuid)
            }
            if (booleanResource(R.bool.is_portrait)) {
                MainLayoutTabletPortrait(catsViewModel, selectedCat) { cat ->
                    selectedCatUUID = cat.uuid
                }
            } else {
                MainLayoutTabletLandscape(catsViewModel, selectedCat) { cat ->
                    selectedCatUUID = cat.uuid
                }
            }
        } else {
            val navController = rememberNavController()
            NavHost(navController, startDestination = NavRoute.CatsList.path) {
                composable(NavRoute.CatsList.path) {
                    CatsScreen(catsViewModel, null) { cat ->
                        navController.navigate("${NavRoute.CatDetails.path}/${cat.uuid}")
                    }
                }
                composable("${NavRoute.CatDetails.path}/{uuid}") { backStackEntry ->
                    val uuid = UUID.fromString(backStackEntry.arguments?.get("uuid") as String)
                    val cat = catsViewModel.findCatByUUID(uuid)
                    CatDetailsScreen(cat) { navController.popBackStack() }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

I didn't see guidelines regarding how to handle tablet and side-by-side layouts, maybe there is something better ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.
